# 🎯 Target Shooting Game

Target Shooting Game is a simple first-person shooter developed in Unreal Engine 5.6 as a learning project. This basic FPS was created by following YouTube tutorials to understand the fundamentals of UE5 development. The game features a straightforward objective: eliminate all targets within the time limit.

## 🎮 Game Concept

In Target Shooting Game, players have **100 seconds** to locate and shoot **5 targets** scattered across a custom-built map. The game emphasizes precision and time management in a visually striking environment created from scratch using advanced UE5 features.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

• **Engine**: Unreal Engine 5.6  
• **Graphics**: Nanite virtualized geometry  
• **Lighting**: Lumen global illumination  
• **Physics**: Chaos Physics system  
• **Programming**: Blueprint visual scripting

## 📚 Learning Objectives

This project served as an introduction to several key UE5 concepts:

• 🧩 **Blueprint Programming**: Visual scripting fundamentals  
• ⚙️ **Chaos Physics**: Physics system management  
• 🎨 **Material Creation**: Custom material development  
• 🏗️ **Static Mesh Creation**: 3D asset development  
• 💡 **Lumen Lighting**: Advanced lighting techniques  
• 🌄 **Landscape Creation**: Terrain generation and sculpting  
• 🌿 **Foliage Systems**: Vegetation placement and optimization  
• 🔧 **Nanite Technology**: Virtualized geometry implementation

## 🎓 Resources

This game was developed following these excellent tutorials:

• **Gameplay Implementation**: [UE5 FPS Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XjgLKrb4_M&t=9367s)  
• **Map Creation**: [UE5 Environment Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-zMkzmduqI&pp=0gcJCccJAYcqIYzv)

## 🎯 How to Play

1. Start the game and the 100-second timer begins
2. Use WASD to move and mouse to look around
3. Left-click to shoot at the targets
4. Eliminate all 5 targets before time runs out to win
5. If time expires with targets remaining, it's game over

## 🎖️ Project Purpose

This is my first game developed in Unreal Engine 5, created purely as a learning exercise to understand the engine's capabilities. The project focuses on fundamental game development concepts rather than innovative gameplay, serving as a stepping stone for future, more complex projects.
